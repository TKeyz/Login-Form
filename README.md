# UX Login-Form
Here's a login page with form and instruction that will allow you to play with it. The idea here was to create a page where the user is at the center of attention during the whole process. In term of User-experience, the design has been thought to push you to go straight to the point as it's very intuitive and efficient.

The authentification is made in two times, first the user type its email address to trigger an AJAX verification to see if the email matchs with the one into the system, to my case I used a simple PHP file but it could be updated, or changed by for instance checking into a database, a JSON file or whatever methods you feel comfortable with.
And when the first control is passed, the user type a password and validate his request to check again, then get logged in.

Made with Javascript, CSS and HTML, this project can be easily implemented to yours if you're familiar with NodeJS and webpacks.
